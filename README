## Syscalls

### Strace

Added `smask` to `struct proc` it is initialized to 0 in allocproc. Two additional arrays were needed, one to store the name of the syscall and one to store the number of arguments the syscall takes, these were called `syscall_names` and `syscall_nargs`

_Code Breakdown_

For the child process to trace the same syscalls as its parent, fork() is modified.
```c
int fork(void) {
  ...
  // child process should get the same mask as the parent process
  // Specification 1
  np->smask = p->smask;
	...
}
```

To store the arguments of the syscall, an array was used before the syscall was run.

```c
int nargs = syscall_nargs[num];
int args[6];
for (int i = 0; i < nargs; i++) {
  argint(i, &args[i]);
}
```

For a syscall to be traced, the corresponding bit should be set in smask, if this bit is set, the syscall trace info is printed after the syscall is executed with the following lines.

```c
// if trace
int trace_call = p->smask & (1 << num);
if (trace_call) { 
  printf("%d: syscall %s (", p->pid, syscall_names[num]);
  for (int i = 0; i < nargs; i++) { 
    printf("%d", args[i]);
    if (i != nargs - 1)
      printf(" ");
  }
  printf(") ");
}

// if traced, print return value
if (trace_call) {
  printf("-> %d\n", p->trapframe->a0);
}
```


### Sigalarm and Sigreturn
Added  syscalls sigalarm  and sigreturn that periodically aler a process as it uses CPU time and is used to invoke some action periodically.

The syscall `sigalarm(interval,handler)` calls the handler function periodically after a specific number of CPU ticks specified by the interval argument.

4 additonal attributes were added to the `struct proc` - `handler`,`alarmOn`,`interval`,`alarmContext` and `nticks`

_Code Breakdown_

```c
uint64 sys_sigalarm(void)
{
  struct proc *p;
  p = myproc();

  int interval;
  uint64 handler;

  argint(0, &interval);
  argaddr(1, &handler);

  p->interval = interval;
  p->handler = handler;

  return 0;
}
```
The above code was written in kernal/sysproc.c and sets the current processes interval and handler attributes the given argumnet values

```c
if (which_dev == 2 && p->alarmOn == 0)
    {
      // this is to check whether the interrupt was from the timer(look at the devintr() function on line 181)
      p->nticks += 1;

      if (p->nticks == p->interval)
      {
        struct trapframe *context = kalloc();
        memmove(context, p->trapframe, PGSIZE);
        p->alarmContext = context;
        p->alarmOn = 1; // done to prevent reentrance (test 2)
        p->trapframe->epc = p->handler;
      }
    }
```

The above code was written in kernal/trap.c and at each timer interupt which happens at each tick we increase the number of ticks that a current process has run and if that number equal that of the interval we save the register values of the process in the alarmContext attribute and change the program counter to point to the address of the handler function.

The  syscall `sigreturn()` resets the process state to that before handler was invoked and this system call must be made before the end of the handler function.

_Code Breakdown_

```c
uint64 sys_sigreturn(void)
{
  struct proc *p;
  p = myproc();

  memmove(p->trapframe, p->alarmContext, PGSIZE);
  int a0 = p->alarmContext->a0;
  kfree(p->alarmContext);
  p->alarmOn = 0;
  p->nticks = 0;
  p->alarmContext = 0;
  // this is done to restore the original value of the a0 register
  // as sys_sigreturn is also a systemcall its return value will be stored in the a0 register
  return a0;
}

```

The above code was written in the kernal/sysproc.c file and restores the register values of the process to that before the handler function was called.
The value stored in the a0 register was returned as to ensure the value in a0 register would stay the same as it contains the return value of the previous syscall.

## Scheduling

## First Come First Serve - FCFS
Non-preemptive, schedules the task with the lowest creation time.

*Code Breakdown*

To disable preemption, we remove the `yield()` calls in `kerneltrap()` and `usertrap()` in trap.c We add `ctime` to `struct proc` which is set to `ticks` a global variable on birth.

```c
static struct proc* allocproc(void) {
	...
	// Specification 2.  
	p->ctime = ticks; // 'ticks' is a global variable in trap.c
	...
}
```
To select the process with the lowest creation time, the code in scheduler() was changed to,
```c
struct proc *fp;
for(fp = proc; fp < &proc[NPROC]; fp++) {
  acquire(&fp->lock);
  if (fp->state != RUNNABLE) {
    release(&fp->lock);
    continue;
  }
  if (p == 0) {
    p = fp;
  } else {
    if (p->ctime > fp->ctime)
      p = fp;
  }
  release(&fp->lock);
}
```
To run the selected process, we have the following code, which acquires the process lock, switches context and changes the state of the process to running, this code is common to all schedulers.

```c
void scheduler(void) {
	...
	if (p) {
	  acquire(&p->lock);
	  if (p->state == RUNNABLE) {
	    p->state = RUNNING;
	    c->proc = p;
	    swtch(&c->context, &p->context);
	    c->proc = 0;
	  }
	  release(&p->lock);
	}
	...
}
```
## Lottery

A probabilistic scheduler that assigns a time slice probabilistic-ally weighted to the number of tickets a process owns.

```c
#define RAND_MAX 32767
int rand(uint64 seed) {
  seed = seed * 1103515245 + 12345;
  return (unsigned int)(seed/65536) % 32768;
}
```
A random value `[0,RAND_MAX]` is generated and the probability that a particular process is run is represented as an interval `[SV, SV+p]` where `SV` is the start value and `p` is the probability(scaled discretely to `[0,RAND_MAX]` instead of over the interval `[0,1]`). The process that gets selected is the process whose interval captures the random value generated.

*Code Breakdown*

First we calculate the total tickets in the system to calculate the weighted probability.

```c
int tot_tk = 0;
struct proc *fp;
for(fp = proc; fp < &proc[NPROC]; fp++) {
  acquire(&fp->lock);
  if (fp->state == RUNNABLE)
    tot_tk += fp->tickets;
  release(&fp->lock);
}
```

Then we generate a random value using current time (ticks) as the seed.
```c
int rv = rand((uint64)ticks);
```

Then we loop over all intervals (explained above) and find the interval that contains the random value, this process is the one that is assigned the time slice.
```c
int sv = 0;
for(fp = proc; fp < &proc[NPROC]; fp++) {
  acquire(&fp->lock);
  if (fp->state == RUNNABLE) {
    int prob = (fp->tickets * RAND_MAX) / tot_tk;
    if (sv <= rv && rv < sv + prob) {
      p = fp;
      release(&fp->lock);
      break;
    }
    sv += prob;
  }
  release(&fp->lock);
}
```
The settickets() syscall can be used to gain tickets by a process.
```c
uint64 sys_settickets(void) {
  struct proc *p;
  int tk;

  argint(0, &tk);
  p = myproc();

  p->tickets += tk;
  return 0;
}
```


## Priority Scheduling - PBS

Non-premptive, Schedules task with lowest dynamic priority value, which is a function of Static Priority and niceness, the former's default value upon process creation is 60 but can be changed by using the syscall  `set_priority(int priority, int pid)` .

```c
uint64 sys_set_priority(void){
  struct proc *p;
  int sp,pid;

  argint(0,&sp);
  argint(1,&pid);

  for(p=proc;p<&proc[NPROC];p++){
    acquire(&p->lock);
    if(p->pid==pid){
      int old_sp = p->staticP;
      p->staticP = sp;
      p->niceness = 5;
      p->pbs_rtime =0;
      p->stime =0;
      p->wtime =0;
      release(&p->lock);
      if(old_sp > sp){
        yield();
      }
      return old_sp;
    }
    release(&p->lock);
  }
  return -1;
}
```

6 attributes have been added to `struct proc` - `pbs_rtime`,`stime`,`wtime`,`niceness`,`staticP`, and `sch_no`

Here we must calculate running time and the sleeping time in order to calculate niceness which is calculated by using the formula

$$Int ((sleeping time)/(sleeping time + running time) * 10 )$$

To calculate running time, we add the following code to kernal/trap.c in the usertrap function

```c
if (which_dev == 2) {
      struct proc *fp;
      for(fp = proc; fp < &proc[NPROC]; fp++) {
        acquire(&fp->lock);

        if (fp->state == RUNNING) fp->pbs_rtime +=1;

        release(&fp->lock);
      }
    }
```

In order to calculate we canot do something similar to that of the running time calculation as multiple CPUs are to be used. Instead we use the `wakeup()` and `sleep()` functions to set the sleep_time and wake_time and thus calculate sleeping time by subtracting sleep_time from the wake_time.

The following code was added to `scheduler` function in the kernal/proc.c file. We iterate through every process in the proc array and we calculate the niceness and the dynamic priority using the following equation

$$DP = max(0,min(SP-niceness + 5,100))$$

```c
struct proc *fp;
    int min_dp = 103;
    for(fp = proc; fp < &proc[NPROC]; fp++) {
      acquire(&fp->lock);
      if (fp->state == RUNNABLE){
        int sleep = fp->wtime - fp->stime;
        if(!sleep && !fp->pbs_rtime){
          fp->niceness = 5;
        }
        else {
          fp->niceness = (int)((sleep/(sleep + fp->pbs_rtime)) * 10);
        }
        int dp = max(0,min(fp->staticP - fp->niceness + 5 , 100));
        if(dp < min_dp){
          p = fp;
          min_dp = dp;
        }
        else if(dp == min_dp){
          if(fp->sch_no < p->sch_no){
            p = fp;
          }
          else if(fp->sch_no == p->sch_no){
            if(fp->ctime < p->ctime){
              p = fp;
            }
          }
        }
      }
      release(&fp->lock);
    }
```
## Multilevel Feedback Queue - MLFQ
A preemptive queue based scheduler. It assigns priority to a queue and changes priority based on whether a process expires its time slice or if it waits for too long in a particular queue. The data structure for the queues - `struct proc *queue[NPR][NPROC]`.

`rticks` and `wticks` was `struct proc` to measure the number of ticks running and waiting in queue respectively. The current priority of the process is also added through `enum procpr pr`.

*Code Breakdown*

To enqueue a process, we loop over the `proc` table and enqueue all `RUNNABLE` processes using `queue_proc()` which finds adds the new process at the tail of the queue.
```c
void queue_proc(struct proc *p) {
  int i;

  for(i = 0; i < NPROC; i++) {
    struct proc *fp = queue[p->pr][i];
    if (fp && fp->pid == p->pid)
      return;
    
    if (!fp) {
      queue[p->pr][i] = p;
      break;
    }
  }
}
```
To dequeue a process that is selected to run or isn’t `RUNNABLE` we use `dequeue_proc()`. Which moves all processes past the removed process one space back to replace the removed process.
```c
void dequeue_proc(struct proc *p) {
  int i, j;

  for(i = 0; i < NPROC; i++) {
    struct proc *fp = queue[p->pr][i];
    if (fp && fp->pid == p->pid) {
      for(j = i + 1; j < NPROC; j++)
        queue[p->pr][j - 1] = queue[p->pr][j];
      
      break;
    }
  }
}
```
To punish a process that expires its time slice, we reduce its priority but assign it more time ticks to execute.

```c
if(which_dev == 2) {
  if (p->rticks == (1 << p->pr)) {
    p->rticks = 0;
    if (p->pr != P4)
      p->pr++;
    yield();
  }
	...
}
```
To age a process, we first update its waiting time by simply looping over the queue, we do not over count the number of ticks because we assume MLFQ to run with only one CPU.
```c
for(i = 0; i < NPR; i++) {
  for(j = 0; j < NPROC; j++) {
    struct proc *fp = queue[i][j];
    if (fp && fp->state == RUNNABLE) {
      fp->wticks++;
    }
  }
}
```
To implement aging, we dequeue an aged process and enqueue it in a higher queue and reset its waiting ticks.
```c
for(i = 1; i < NPR; i++) {
  for(j = 0; j < NPROC; j++) {
    fp = queue[i][j];
    if (fp && fp->wticks >= 10) {
      dequeue_proc(fp);
      fp->pr--;
      fp->wticks = 0;
      queue_proc(fp);
    }
  }
}
```
If a higher priority process exists, then the current process is preempted even if it did not finish its time slice, it is however not penalized in this case and is added back to the same queue it was preempted from.

```c
if(which_dev == 2) {
  ...
  // check if higher priority process exists
  for(i = 0; i < p->pr; i++) {
    for(j = 0; j < NPROC; j++)
      if (!queue[i][j])
        break;
      
    if (j) {
      // higher priority process available (don't reset rticks)
      yield();
    }
  }
}
```
We then choose the highest possible priority process available, this implements the round robin implicitly at the last level.

```c
p = 0;
for (i = 0; i < NPR; i++) {
  for (j = 0; j < NPROC; j++) {
    fp = queue[i][j];
    if (fp) {
      if (fp->state == RUNNABLE) {
        dequeue_proc(fp);
        p = fp;
        p->wticks = 0;
        goto schedule;
      } else
        dequeue_proc(fp);
    } else
      break;
  }
}
```
The selected process `p` is then run by switching context and changing the state of `p`.

## Copy On Write

To implement copy on write, we modify the functions fork uses to prevent the copy of memory and instead map both the processes pagetables to point to the same memory.

To identify when either process tries to write to the memory, we remove write permissions from the mapped memory, then when a process tries to write to it a page fault is raised and then we can detect this and allocate the page properly with write permissions.

This makes knowing when to call `kfree` on a memory block much harder as many processes can refer to the same process, the way we dealt with this is by only freeing the block when no process refers to the block. To do this, we modify `kalloc` and `kfree` and store the number of processes referring to a particular page.

*Code Breakdown*

The following struct was added to kalloc.c to keep track of the number of processes referring to a particular page.

```c
struct {
  struct spinlock lock;
  int fr[fn(PHYSTOP) + 1];
  char lock_kalloc;
} memref;
```
